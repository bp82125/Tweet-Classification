# Tweet Classification

This project was the final assignment for the CT312 Data Mining course. It served as a playground to preprocess the dataset, experiment with feature extraction techniques, and train machine learning models for tweet classification.

## About

The goal was to classify tweets as disaster-related or not using machine learning techniques. This repository is an archive of my work on this project, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training experiments.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explore [pre_process.ipynb](pre_process.ipynb) for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Notebooks such as [bag_of_words.ipynb](bag_of_words.ipynb), [tf_idf.ipynb](tf_idf.ipynb), and [word2vec.ipynb](word2vec.ipynb) test different methods for extracting features.
3. **Model Training**: Train and evaluate models using the prepared data. Some of the deep learning models can be found in the [DL](./DL) folder.

## Notes

- The dataset is stored in [Disaster_Tweets_train.csv](Disaster_Tweets_train.csv).
- This repository is for archival purposes and reflects my learning process during the course.
